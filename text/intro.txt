I graduated from Stanford University in 2018 and have a passion for tinkering, designing, and programming. One of my biggest interests is the intersection software and design. If I'm not working on a personal project, you'll likely find me playing competitive smash bros, trying to capture the perfect photo, or learning a new language.`

I used to create and sell themes for jailbroken iPhones via <a class="c" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydia" target="_blank">Cydia</a>, created automated mobile phone theming solutions at <a class="c" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod" target="_blank">Cyanogen</a>, worked at Stanford's <a class="c" href="https://hpcc.stanford.edu" target="_blank">High Performance Computing Center</a>, and worked on a platform for increasing accessibility of affordable solar power in developing countries at <a class="c" href="http://www.angaza.com" target="_blank">Angaza</a>. Currently at <a class="c" href="http://www.meta.com" target="_blank">Meta</a> working on <a class="c" href="https://github.com/facebook/Ax" target="_blank">adaptive experimentation</a>.```
